# Code executor
An extendible remote code execution webserver.

- [ ] Use the config file
- [ ] Re-write in Rust
- [ ] Dockerize and use Kuberenetes for load balancing
- [ ] Find all the possible exploits
- [ ] Allow to ban keywords (say to forbid using certain imports)
- [ ] Make sure that containers are completely disconnected from the internet.

TODO: Re-write this in RUST because yes, for now typescript is faster to implement.
